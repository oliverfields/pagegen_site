Setup
-----

Assuming Debian based OS, download `latest .deb </include/download/PAGEGEN_LATEST_DEB>`_, install and create new pagegen site directory according to the following. For other installation options please see `installation </user-manual/installation>`_.

.. code::

	$ wget http://pagegen.phnd.net/include/download/PAGEGEN_LATEST_DEB
	$ dpkg -i PAGEGEN_LATEST_DEB
	$ mkdir my_site
	$ cd my_site
	$ pagegen --init

The last command sets up the current directory with a basic pagegen framework of files and folders.


Create example site
-------------------

We are going to create our site according to this outline.

* Home page

* Fruit

	* Pear

	* Apple

* Contact us

Ensure the commands below are run from *my_site* directory. They will first delete the example site content which comes with Pagegen and create the site as outlined above.

.. code::

	$ rm -Rf content/*
	$ echo "This is the home page" > content/index.html
	$ mkdir content/Fruit
	$ echo "All directories must have a file named index" > content/Fruit/index.html
	$ echo "We want Pear first in menu" > content/Fruit/001_Pear.html
	$ echo "We want Apple last" > content/Fruit/002_Apple.html
	$ echo "Who ya gonna call" > content/Contact\ us.html


Generate example site
---------------------

We are now ready to generate the site. This will create the finished site in the *my_site/site* directory.

.. code::

	$ pagegen --generate

The **my_site/site** directory now contains a freshly generated site ready for upload to a web server.

The generated site maps to the above outline as follows.

.. csv-table::
	:header: "Name", "Site"

	"Home page","index.html"
	"Fruit","fruit/index.html"
	"Pear","fruit/pear.html"
	"Apple","fruit/apple.html"
	"Contact us","contact-us.html"


Customize layout
-----------------------

Pagegen adds layout and navigation elements to each page when they are processed. To change the site look and feel change **my_site/page.template** and add required elements to **my_site/include** directory, e.g. css, images, javascript etc..
