Title: Plugin installation
Description: Add me

Plugins are installed in a few steps.

1. Ensure that root site directory has a `plugins` directory, if not create it
2. Create a directory for the plugin to be installed in `plugins` and copy the plugin files there
3. Enable the plugin in `site.conf` in the `[site]` section adding `<plugin name>` to `enabled_plugins` setting. The list of plugin names must be separated by commas
4. Optionally add any configuration to `site.conf`, see plugin documentation
5. Optionally add plugin to any `hook_*` settings if the order of plugin execution is required for correct operation (if not set Pagegen will execute in alphabetical order)
