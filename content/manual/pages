Title: Pages
Date: 2025-02-13
Description: Pages consist of zero or more headers and content, which can be plain text, html or Markdown

A page is a simple text file consisting of optinal headers and a body of content.

    [<header name>: <header value>]
    [...]
    
    The rest is content.


## Naming

The page name will become part of the generated page URL, as such it should be alphanumeric. It is customary to use dash (-) to replace spaces. This also applies to the directories.

The file may have any extension that makes sense after it **has** been generated. For instance a page containing markdown could have the extension .html as this is what it will be called in the generated `build` directory.


## Headers

All headers are optional. They must start on the first line and content start is signaled by a blank line after the headers. Headers are often referred to as front matter by static site generation engines.

Pagegen recognizes the following headers, but more may be used or required by plugins.

| Header name | Values | Description |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Cache | True, False | Determines if page is generated each time |
| Render| True, False | Determines if page content is processed |
