Pagegen sites are just plain text files containing page headers and content and organized by directory hierarchy. A pagegen site is generally organized as follows:

<pre>
├── assets              Image/media files
├── build               Generated site
├── content             Page content
├── plugins             Custom plugins
├── site.conf           Configuration file
└── themes              Themes
    └── &lt;theme name&gt;    A theme
        ├── assets      Theme image/media files
        └── templates   Templates
</pre>

## Assets directory

Contains image/media files required for the generated site.

By default this directory is copied to the `build` directory on generation. This can be disabled in `site.conf` with the `copy_assets_to_build_dir` setting.


## Build directory

When `pgn -g` is run generated content ends up here. The content of this directory is the finished site, and can be uploaded to a web server.


## Content directory

The contents of this directory is where [pages](/manual/pages) are stored and organized using directories.

Each file in the content directory becomes a page and the directory structure is copied verbatim to the `build` directory.

File and directory names will therefore become the urls of the generated site, as such they should be named accordingly.

!!! note

    Prefer to name files and directories only with lowercase ascii alphanumeric characters and using dashes (-) to separate words


## Plugins directory

Directory for custom [plugins](/manual/plugins).


## Site.conf configuration file

Site configuration file. The `pgn` command will search the current directory and its parents until it finds `site.conf`. Similar to how `git` works.


## Themes directory

Themes consist of `assets` and templates. The `assets` directory is copied to `build/theme` when site is generated.

Pagegen comes with [Mako templates plugin](/manual/plugins/bundled), that looks in `themes/&lt;theme name&gt;/templates` for templates.
