Pagegen takes content found in a bunch of regular plain text files and folders and wraps them up nicely as a website. You can focus on writing content, and pagegen will do it up for web.

Pagegen builds sites incrementally, using extensive caching and inspection to only build what is new or has changed.

The core is kept small and lightweight and supports custom plugins to expand functionality.
