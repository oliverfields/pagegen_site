Description: Hooks are user customizable executables that may be run at specific points during the site generation process.
Markup: rst

To make the static site more dynamic(pun intended) Pagegen can run executables (hooks) at preset times, during the generation process.

To enable a hook make the appropriate hook file executable (``chmod +x hooks/hook_file``).

.. tip::

	Run ``pagegen --init`` on empty directory and see ``hooks`` directory for examples. To use an example remove ``.example`` and ensure the script is executable.

Run one of the example hooks to see the available environment variables. All settings in the current ``site.conf`` environment are set, named ``PAGEGEN_<setting name>``.

::

	cd hooks
	mv pre_generate.example pre_generate
	chmod +x pre_generate
	pagegen -g <environment>
