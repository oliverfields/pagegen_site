All necessary files for a freshly generated site are found in the **site directory**. To publish the site, this directory must be uploaded to the web server. The site will work out of the box if sane settings are used, but a little configuration of the web server can make the site more friendly to humans and crawlers.

.. tip::
	All links generated by Pagegen are by default relative and assume the site is located directly on the web root folder (e.g. http://mysite.com/). If the site is to be in any other location the **base_url** setting in **site.conf** must be set accordingly and ensure that **absolute_urls** setting is removed.

.. tip:: If using Apache the .htaccess file can be saved as a normal page in the **content directory**. Most likely the headers should be: **Generate html: False**, **Menu exclude: True** and **Sitemap exclude: True**


Nice URLs
*********

File name extensions are optional to Pagegen, however if they are not used the web server must be configured to serve extensionless files with the correct mime type.

The configuration below tells the web server to set the HTTP *Content-Type* header to *text/html* for all files, exept if the file has an extension, in wich case use default mime type.


Apache
======

.. code::

	 # Force text/html for all files
	<FilesMatch "\.*">
	  ForceType text/html
	</FilesMatch>
	
	# Use default type for files that have an extension
	<FilesMatch "\.[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,4}$">
	  ForceType none
	</FilesMatch>

Serve default file
******************

If no file specified in request, as happens when accessing a directory on the web site, it is nice if the web server returns a default file, instead of a directory listing (which can be the default).

Content files for directories are **index** (with optional extension), the web server should serve the **index** file  when the user requests a directory.

Apache
======

Set the DirectoryIndex in the appropriate configuration file (e.g. .htaccess).

.. code::

	 DirectoryIndex default

Custom error pages
******************

On an error web servers can be configured to serve custom error pages (e.g a 404 if a file was not found). Error pages content can be handled by Pagegen if required, but the web server needs to be told where to find them. Error pages for the following types could be a fair starting point.

* 403 - Access forbidden
* 404 - Page not found
* 500 - Internal server error

Create the following files with appropriate content. Set the page headers to **Menu exclude: True** and **Sitemap exclude: True** to hide them from menu and sitemap.

* content/403.html
* content/404.html
* content/500.html


Apache
======

For Apache the following will specify which error page to show. Add the following to the appropriate configuration file (e.g. .htaccess).

.. code::

	ErrorDocument 403 /403.html
	ErrorDocument 404 /404.html
	ErrorDocument 500 /500.html
