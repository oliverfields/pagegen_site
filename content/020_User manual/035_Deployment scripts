Description: How to deploy finished HTML files from Pagegen to host server.

After generation the generated HTML will be in the **site directory/<environment>**, Pagegen can optionally run deployment scripts to upload the site to a host server.

The following settings in **site.conf** enable FTP deployment for the **Test** environment. Deployment settings must be added per environment section. An environment may have separate deployment options, e.g. test environment to local machine and production environment to FTP server.

::

	[test]
	...
	deploy_script=ftp.py
	ftp_host=<ftp host name>
	ftp_username=<username>
	ftp_password=<password>
	ftp_target_directory=<target directory on ftp server>

After generation **deploy_scripts/ftp.py** will upload new site to the FTP site in the **ftp_target_directory**.


Creating new deploy scripts
***************************

Deploy scripts are any executable scripts found in the **site directory/deploy_scripts** directory.

Setting **deploy_script=<script name>** in  **site.conf** will run **site directory/deploy_scripts/<script name>** after site generation.

Settings for the script may be set in **site.conf**. Any extra settings defined in the site section will be available as environment variables named as **PAGEGEN_<UPPERCASE NAME OF SETTING>**

.. tip::

	Deployment scripts are welcome, please get in touch if you want to share:)

Example **site.conf** for deployment script Foo.

::

	[production]
	...
	deploy_script=foo.py
	foo_access_token=<token>
	foo_url=<url>

After generation Pagegen will run **site directory/deploy_scripts/foo.py** with the following environment variables set for the script to use.

* PAGEGEN_FOO_ACCESS_TOKEN
* PAGEGEN_FOO_URL

Other environment variables are also set.
