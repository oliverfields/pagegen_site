Pagegen has built in functionality to support blogging.

## Posts

Blog posts can be organized using directories anywhere in the **content** directory. For example.

- content/posts/&lt;post&gt;
- content/posts/january/<&lt;post&gt;

Typically a list of posts will be provided on the front page. This can be achieved by using the built-in shortcode list_pages. The shortcode requires a directory to find posts in and how many posts to show. Assuming posts are somewhere in the **content/posts** directory then the following will list 10 newest of them in the posts directory or any of its sub directories.

	&lt;sc&gt;list_posts('posts', 10)&lt;/sc&gt;

!!! Note
	Posts are sorted by their **publish** header (in page front matter), if this is not set it defaults to the current date

Templates allow greater flexibility in presentation. The site.page_list attribute contains all posts, so is an accessible way to iterate over all pages and pick out the ones to list.
