Description: Static content belongs in the assets and themes/&lt;theme name&gt;/assets directories.

A site needs static assets for things like Javascript, CSS and images. There are two asset directories that are copied to the `site/<environment>` directory on generation.

When generating the site all contents in the `assets` directory is copied to the output directory (see [Site generation](/user-manual/site-generation)). Additionally the `themes/<theme name>/assets` directory is copied to the `output folder/assets/theme` directory.


## CSS, Javascript and images

Add content, such as CSS, Javascript and images (or anything else) to these directories to have them included with the generated site.


## Minification

HTML, CSS and Javascript may be minified by setting any of the following to options in `site.conf`.

* minify_html=True
* minify_css=True
* minify_javascript=True
