A key feature of Pagegen is that each page has a full site menu on each page. The menu can be customized as follows.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Absolute URLs | `site.conf` setting `absolute_urls` toggles relative or absolute URLs in menu |
| Exclude page | Pages with header `Menu exclude` are not removed from menu. Any child pages will also be removed |
| Menu title | Use `Menu title` value in menu, instead of page title |
| Order | Prefix file or directories in `content directory` with `<integer>_` to order menu items |
