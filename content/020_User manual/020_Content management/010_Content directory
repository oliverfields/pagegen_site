Description: Pagegen uses regular file system files and directories to organize and store content.

Content is stored as regular files and organized using directories and naming conventions.

## Content directory

Pagegen pages are just plain text files containing page options and content organized by directory hierarchy. Each directory is treated as a page containing child pages. For directories the page content is either stored in file named `index` within each directory. If no `index` file is defined one will be generated containing list of the directory contents. The index file is identical, in both syntax and structure, to regular page files.

Pages contain headers(options/settings, also known as front matter) and reStructuredText or Markdown markup. All page content is located in the `/content` directory.

!!! tip
	The front/home page is `content/index`.
