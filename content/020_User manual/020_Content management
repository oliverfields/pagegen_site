Description: Organization and management of Pagegen content. Including file naming conventions, content file headers (front matter) and content markup (reStructuredText).

Content is stored as regular files and organized with directories and naming.

Content directory
*****************

Pagegen pages are just plain text files containing page options and content organized by directory hierarchy. Each directory is treated as a page containing child pages. For directories the page content is either stored in file named **index** within each directory, or if no **index** file is defined one will be generated containting list of the directory contents. The index file is identical, in both syntax and structure, to regular page files.

Pages (a file or both a directory and file) contain headers(options/settings, also known as front matter) and reStructuredText markup. All page content is located in the **content directory** (<pagegen directory>/content).

.. tip::

	The front/home page is **content/index**.


Naming
******

The name of the file, or directory, are used to determine the final page attributes title, URL and optionally menu sort order. The name of pages, both files and directories & **index** file, are treated the alike, except for the extension. The page path name is used to create the URL to the page.

.. warning::

	On generation a **sitemap.xml** will be created, unless disabled in site configuration. A page can therefor not be called **content/sitemap.xml**.

.. important::

	**Name syntax: [<sort order>_]<title>[.<extension>]**


Title
=====

The page title will become the file or directory name without the sort order or extension (unless overridden using Title header, see below). The title can contain any legal file name character, except a period(.).


Sort order
==========

Pages are sorted in the menu by listing them alphabetically, to override the default sort files and directories can be prefixed by integers followed by an underscore. The sort prefix will be stripped from the title and URL.

.. tip::

	A good practice is to use increments of 10 when setting the sort prefix (010\_, 020\_, 030\_ etc.). This means an item can be added in the sequence with for instance 011\_ without having to rename all items.


Extension
=========

An extension is optional and is left as is. Directory index files can also have extensions.


URL
===

The page URL will be the path from the **content directory** to the file, converted to lower case. Where sort prefix is removed and all characters that are not a-z, 0-9, dash(-), underscore(_) or period(.) are replaced with dash(-), file extensions are kept, if they are present.

================================== =============== =================


Page file structure
*******************

Content for each page consists of an optional header containing any settings for the page followed by a blank line and reStructuredText or Markdown markup.

::

	[<header name>: <header value>]
	[...]
	
	The rest is content marked up using reStructuredText or Markdown


Headers
=======

All headers are optional. They must start on the first line and content start is signaled by a blank line after the headers. Headers are often referred to as front matter by static site generation engines.

Page markup
===========

Pages are marked up using either `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html>`_ or `Markdown <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_. In **site.conf* setting **default_markup** can be either **rst** (the default) or **md**, pages can override the sitewide configuration by setting header **markup** in the page headers/frontmatter.

Some files that comprise a web site may just be regular text files. These files can be setup by using the page header **generate html: false**, in which case Pagegen will dump file contents as-is, without running it through reStructuredText or Markdown engine.

.. tip::

	robots.txt or .htaccess are files that should be configured with **generate html: false** header.


Executable files
================

Content files may be executables. If a file is executable its content from stdout will be used instead of actual file content. The output form the executable is treated identically to a regular content file, so it may specify headers and non-header content will be passed to the appropriate markup engine.

Example shell script
--------------------

::

	#!/bin/bash
	
	#Print any desired headers, e.g.
	echo "Title: This will be the page title"
	echo "" # Start content
	echo "$(hostname)"
