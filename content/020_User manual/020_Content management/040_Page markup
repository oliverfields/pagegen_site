Description: Pagegen supports reStructuredText or Markdown markup.
Markup: md

Pages are marked up using either [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html) or [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). In **site.conf* setting **default_markup** can be either **rst** (the default) or **md**, pages can override the site wide configuration by setting header **markup** in the page headers/front matter.

!!! tip
	View markup used on this site using the <i class="fas code-999999"></i> link at the very bottom of each page.

Some files that comprise a web site may just be regular text files. These files can be setup by using the page header **generate html: false**, in which case Pagegen will dump file contents as-is, without running it through reStructuredText or Markdown engine.

!!! tip
	robots.txt or .htaccess are files that should be configured with **generate html: false** header.


!!! warning
	Graphviz support for either reStructuredText or Markdown requires Graphviz installed


## reStructuredText support

Pagegen supports standard reStructuredText. Also inline Graphviz graphs are supported, see [python-docutils-graphviz](https://pypi.org/project/python-docutils-graphviz/).


## Markdown

Pagegen Markdown is implemented by [Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/), see the documentation for exact Markdown support. In addition inline Graphviz graphs are supported, syntax as follows:

	<graphviz>dot my-graph.svg
	digraph a {
		b -> c
	}
	</graphviz>

The above produces the following:

<graphviz>dot my-graph.svg
	digraph a {
		b -> c
	}
</graphviz>

There is support for other Graphviz commands, simply replace **dot** in the example above with any of the following:

* dot
* neato
* fdp
* sfdp
* twopi
* circo

Replace .svg with .png to generate inline PNGs.
