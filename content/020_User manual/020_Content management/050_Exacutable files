Description: Pages may be output from executable files. If a file is executable it is run at time of site generation, and the output used as basis for further processing.

Content files may be executables. If a file is executable its content from stdout will be used instead of actual file content. The output form the executable is treated identically to a regular content file, so it may specify headers and non-header content will be passed to the appropriate markup engine.

## Example shell script

	#!/bin/bash
	
	#Print any desired headers, e.g.
	echo "Title: This will be the page title"
	echo "" # Start content
	echo "$(hostname)"
