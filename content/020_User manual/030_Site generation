Description: How to generate finished HTML files from Pagegen content files and the available configuration settings.

On generation Pagegen will build site from pages in **content directory**. The command must be run from the Pagegen root directory or one of its sub directories.

::

	$ Pagegen --generate

After generation the generated HTML will be in the **site directory**, simply copy this directory to your web server to go live:)

Site generation involves first creating page HTML in the **site directory**, creating sitemap and copying **include directory** to the **site directory**.

Site generation can be configured by the **site.conf**, found in the Pagegen root directory.
